# Financial-News-Keyword-Extraction
An application that webscrapes for daily financial news on Reuters.com, extracts the keywords from each article, and sends each articles name, 
url, and repsective keywords to my personal email everyday at 8:30 AM. The application uses statistical NLP techiniques such as TF-IDF Vectorization,
as well as automation tools such as crontab.

This application encompasses both bash scripting and python scripting.
